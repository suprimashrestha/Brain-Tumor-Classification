## About 
In our project, we have used Deep learning architecture for the classification of Brain Tumor because of its capability for the early detection of diseases or any other irregular patterns. In our study, we have used an MRI dataset as it gives a more detailed picture than any other tomography. Our dataset consists of four types of brain tumors which are pituitary tumors, meningioma tumors, glioma tumors, and no tumor. The input image size of 224 *224 is used for fine processing. We have used VGG-16 and built a model from scratch which gave the validation accuracy of around 95%. We have evaluated our model with the matrices confusion matrices and f1 score. Our study gave the best result for pituitary tumors and no tumor whereas results for meningioma and glioma tumors aren't classified properly. Therefore, these experiments also use the Class Activation Map. function. The experiment gives a detailed study of brain tumor classification and compares the two model.
